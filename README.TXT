How to play:
     The player whose turn it is chooses some square of a positive whole number (such as 1, 4, 9, 16, . . . ) to subtract 
     from the value, provided the chosen square is not larger. After subtracting, we have a new value and the next player 
     chooses a square to subtract from it.
How to win:
     Play continues to alternate between the two players until no moves are possible. Whoever is about to play at that point loses.
